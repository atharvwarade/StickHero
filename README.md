# StickHero Game

StickHero is a simple yet addictive game where you control a character who needs to cross platforms using a stick. The stick's length can be adjusted to ensure it spans the gap between two platforms. The challenge is to measure the length correctly to avoid falling.

## Features

- **Simple Controls**: Press and hold the mouse button to extend the stick. Release the button to let the stick fall.
- **Player Revival**: Option to revive the player using collected cherries.
- **Score Tracking**: Keep track of your high score and current score.
- **Animated Character**: Character rotates and moves based on stick length and platform positions.
- **Cherry Collection**: Collect cherries to gain points and use them for revival.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stickhero.git

## How to Play

1. **Start the Game**: Launch the game and click "Start" on the main menu.
